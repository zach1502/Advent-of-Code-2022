## Some Christmas Wishes

Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all participants in Advent of Code 2022!

As we approach the end of the year, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your participation in this annual event. Solving these challenging puzzles has been so much fun, and it's been great to see the creative solutions that everyone has come up with. The dedication to these puzzles has been an inspiration, and I am grateful for the AoC community!

I hope that the holiday season brings you joy, love, and cheer, and that you have a chance to relax and enjoy the company of loved ones. And as we look ahead to the new year, let's continue to push ourselves to learn, grow, and tackle new challenges together. I can't wait to see what exciting puzzles and solutions the new year will bring.
